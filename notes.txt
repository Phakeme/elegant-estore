// What I have learned from this Project
- Lifting the State in React
- Component Namespace
- Dynamic Object Assignment
- React components automatically re-render whenever there is a change in their state or props
- The array destructuring assignment on the left-hand side of the assignment to define what values to unpack from the sourced variable
